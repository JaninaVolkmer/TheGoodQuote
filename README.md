# TheGoodQuote
TheGoodQuote is a social media web application for teams and small groups created with the Flask web Framework. 
After the registration and login on the platform, users can sent DMâ€™s, share posts to an open timeline and work together on a central task list. 
This project also includes Flask-Mail to solve authentication related problems, like a password reset. 
After a request, the application will send an email with a link so the user has access to a form to set a new password.
